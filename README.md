# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge.

## Language

I am using C# for this year's challenge. I'd consider myself proficient in C#, but on a day to day basis I don't use it as much and would just like to get more practice with it.

## Structure

Each day's solution is contained in a separate folder. Each folder contains:

- A `PROBLEM.md` file containing the problem description.
- A `INPUT.txt` file containing the input for the problem.
- A dotnet console application containing the solution.
- An xUnit test project containing unit tests for the solution.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)

### Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, navigate to the solution folder and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet run -- <path-to-input-file>
```

Or for part 2 solutions

```bash
dotnet run -- <path-to-input-file> part2
```

## Challenges

| Day | Problem                    |            Solution             | Status | Notes                                                               |
| --- | -------------------------- | :-----------------------------: | :----: | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01  | [Problem](./01/PROBLEM.md) |   [Solution](./01/Trebuchet/)   |   ✅   | The trickiest part here was accounting for overlapping digit words. |
| 02  | [Problem](./02/PROBLEM.md) | [Solution](./02/CubeConundrum/) |   ✅   | The key to me here was to parse the input into a useful model.      |
| 03  | [Problem](./03/PROBLEM.md) |  [Solution](./03/GearRatios/)   |   ✅   | The edge case that got me here was lines ending with a part number. |
| 04  | [Problem](./04/PROBLEM.md) | [Solution](./04/Scratchcards/)  |   ✅   | Part 2 gets out of hand quickly with just 200 cards.                |
| 05  | [Problem](./05/PROBLEM.md) |    [Solution](./05/IYGASAF/)    |   ✅   | I brute forced part 2 using parallelism. I know shame.              |
